                I love the intersection of technology and art!
            </p>
            <p>
                I've done crafts for many years. In recent years in particular, though, I have really enjoyed incorporating technology into my art, through many different means. These means have included soft circuits, scannable cross-stitched QR codes, and using tools like cross-stitch to reinforce concepts like the box model and RGB/CYMK color theory. Please enjoy the examples below!
            </p>
            <h2>the box model</h2>
            <div class="img-wrapper">
                <img src="./public/images/box_model_stitch.png" alt="a cross-stitched box model, showing the layers of this CSS concept. This is shown through an innermost blue layer, 'content', surrounded by a green layer, 'padding,' which is surrounded by a yellow layer, 'margin,' and finally a red layer, 'border.'">
            </div>
            <h2>soft circuits (find and squash bugs)</h2>
            <div class="img-wrapper">
                <img src="./public/images/dead_bug_stitch.jpg" alt="a cross-stitch of the phrase 'find bug seven times, fix bug eight' with a stitched flea inside of a stitched magnifying glass.">
                <img src="./public/images/lit_bug_stitch.jpg" alt="the same cross-stitch of the phrase 'find bug seven times, fix bug eight' with a stitched flea inside of a stitched magnifying glass, but the flea is lit up and glowing red">
            </div>
            <h2>RGB and color theory</h2>
            <div class="img-wrapper">
                <img src="./public/images/first_led_stitch.jpg" alt="a cross-stitched representation of the RGB/CYMK color model. there are overlapping sections of color, like a venn diagram. Red, blue, and green create yellow, magenta, cyan, and white where they overlap. The diagram is labeled with #RRGGBB and each section is labeled with its hex code (#FF0000 for red, #00FF00 for green, and so forth). These labels are a bit hard to read as they are placed on top of the colors.">
                <img src="./public/images/second_led_stitch.jpg" alt="a second cross-stitched representation of the RGB/CYMK color model. This one is a bit smaller, so the diagram itself looks cleaner, and the sections are labeled on the white background rather than on top of the sections of color. It is labeled with #RRGGBB and a maker's mark of 'ln'. It's easier to read, but less artistic than, its predecessor.">

            <h2>QR cross-stitch: log in to my friend Emily's wi-fi network</h2>
            <div class="img-wrapper">
                <img src="./public/images/qr-emily-final.jpg" alt="A cross-stitched QR code. There is a border of blue and green around the code.">
            </div>
            <h2>:w saves (vim reminder)</h2>
            <div class="img-wrapper">
                <img src="./public/images/w_saves_stitch.jpg" alt="A cross-stitch of the praying hands emoji labeled ':w saves'. There is a blocky border decoration around the sides and top of the stitched emoji in the very old vim logo colors of orange, light blue, and navy blue">
