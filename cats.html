            <p>I have two wonderful cats, Starbuck and Athena (yes, I got them shortly after my first watch through of Battlestar Galactica). They are my sweetlings, my darlings, my little loves.</p>

                <img id="starbuck-pic" alt="A black cat looks at the camera. There is a tiny jouster stairs to a blue saddle on her back. The saddle is trimmed with yellow. The jouster has a red feather in their helmet. There is a dark blue curtain patterned with stars behind them." src="./public/images/brave_ser_buck.jpg">
                <div class="cat-text-wrapper">
                    <h2>Starbuck</h2>
                    <p>aka Baby Buck, the Bucklette, Buckles, Brave Ser Buck, Demon Child, Snuffleupakit, the Scremlin. She's a bit shy with new people, but once she warms up to you, she's not at all afraid to beg for attention. She has been known to crawl under my back while I'm doing sit-ups and to try to lick all the salt off of my arm when I'm sleeping at 4a.m. She's a playful delight, and so full of character!</p>

                    <h2>Athena</h2>
                    <p>aka Athene Bean, Beans, Miss Beans, Beanie Baby, Snugglebeans, the Beanlette, the Princess. She's a sweet, inquisitive little darling who loves nothing more than a snuggle. She likes to try to nibble on my stomach at night when I go to bed, and if I am staying up late, she's not afraid to find and harass me until I allow her to begin the nightly ritual. She's a champion cuddler, and time with her is full of soft petulant mews and deep, sleepy love.</p>

The cat stares cozily at the camera, totally at peace spread out in her human. There are blankets, pillows, the butt of a stuffed animal around them." src="./public/images/snugglebeans.jpg">
