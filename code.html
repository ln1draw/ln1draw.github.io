            <p>I've been a web developer for the past 10 years!</p>
            <p>I learned to code in 2014 as a part of the inaugural class of the Ada Developers Academy, so you know that I'm willing to take a risk if it has enough potential.</p>
            <p>Much of my experience is in consulting, which means that while I'm a frontend-leaning fullstack developer, I am fairly language-agnostic. My consulting experience helps me think about code as a system and ramp up very quickly on a wide variety of technologies. I've had to solve problems in Ruby on Rails, in Django, in PHP and Laravel, in Java, in frontend frameworks (including but not limited to AngularJS and React), in Tailwind, in Bootstrap, and of course in plain HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.</p>
            <p>I love developing niche or neglected expertise to fill gaps on my teams. This has led me into passions for accessibility, SEO, and testing, among other things. Often, I find that these features are expensive and daunting to retrofit into an existing codebase, but relatively simple to build into your work. I enjoy using code reviews and team advancement initiatives like Tech Talks and study groups to make sure I am continually improving those skills.</p>
            <p>I also have a deep love for building process improvements. That hour I spent writing code may be very productive; the hour I spend improving my team's ability to write code will probably deliver much larger dividends.</p>
            <p>I've worked on a wide range of teams, as well. I have been the only engineer helping a small business decide what they want their website to be and building it for them; I have worked at a Fortune 500 company on a team with multiple product owners, 6+ engineers at any moment, and dedicated QA and design team members, at a company with hundreds of other engineers. Each kind of team has its own strengths and weaknesses. In my experience, the success and the happiness of the team depends more on their willingness to work together to iterate and build improvements than it does on the precise number and kind of teammates involved.</p>
            <p>Building software is a team sport. It goes better when we work together.</p>
