            <p>I've been a musician for most of my life, and I have been a singer-songwriter since I was 16 and I stole my oldest brother's guitar.</p>
            <p>In college, I went to every single open mic night that was available to me. I had a couple of solo concerts. I performed at campus events, including new student orientation, fundraisers, and the Arts Walk. It was possibly the best part of my college experience.</p>
            <p>Now, most of my performing is online. I post new music over at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@lenny_wonders">YouTube as Lenny Wonders.</a></p>
            <p>In February 2024, I participated in the February Album Writing Month challenge and successfully wrote 14 songs that month, almost all of which I am quite proud of. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxGB81R3Esqoqr3knbcmsIMDzYNcvkWSW">The FAWM playlist on YouTube</a> has all of those songs, starting with my least favorite (I can't resist starting a playlist with "the end;" sometimes I make silly decisions!)</p>
            <p>Here's a few songs you might like!</p>
